        <p>These snowman cupcakes are too cute! Perfect for a festive classroom or work holiday party. These cupcakes are very easy to make and the whole family will enjoy decorating them!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>24 unfrosted vanilla cupcakes</li>
              <li>1 (16 ounce) package vanilla frosting, divided</li>
              <li>4 black licorice laces</li>
              <li>6 red licorice laces</li>
              <li>1 ounce ready-to-use white fondant</li>
              <li>1 drop orange food coloring</li>
              <li>48 candy-coated milk chocolate pieces (such as M&M's)</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
              <li>Trim the dry top off 12 of the cupcakes and crumble the soft cake interiors into a bowl. Add about 5 ounces of vanilla icing and mix well. Add more frosting if needed to bring the mixture together into a ball so that it can be easily shaped. Cover bowl and chill cake mixture in the fridge for 20 minutes.</li>
              <li>Frost remaining 12 cupcakes with a thin layer of white vanilla frosting.</li>
              <li>Remove cake mixture and roll with wet hands into 2 different sized balls for the snowmen's torsos and heads, 12 bigger balls and 12 smaller balls. Stick a small ball on top of a big ball to make the snowman, using some frosting if the balls are not very sticky. Place snowmen onto frosted cupcakes.</li>
              <li>Cut black licorice laces into small squares for the eyes and mouth using scissors and attach them with the tip of a knife to the head.</li>
              <li>Mix white fondant with orange food coloring to turn it orange and make little carrot noses out of the orange fondant. Press into the snowman faces.</li>
              <li>Attach 2 dark colored candy-coated milk chocolate pieces into the torso and cupcake as buttons. Attach 2 candy-coated milk chocolate pieces on either side of the head and connect them with a piece of black licorice for the earmuffs.</li>
              <li>Cut red licorice laces into 2 1/2-inch long pieces and wrap around the snowman's neck as a scarf.</li>
          </ol>
